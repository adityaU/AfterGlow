Improved concurrency primitives for Ember.js. Documentation can be
found [here](http://ember-concurrency.com).

## Installation

`ember-concurrency` is an ember-cli addon. You can install it via:

    ember install ember-concurrency

If you're using a version of `ember-concurrency` older than 0.7.5,
you'll also need to run:

    ember install ember-maybe-import-regenerator

## Documentation

The [ember-concurrency documentation site](http://ember-concurrency.com) is an ember-cli app
with interactive examples powered by ember-concurrency. It runs from
ember-concurrency's [dummy test app](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency/tree/master/tests/dummy/app)
(thanks to [ef4](https://github.com/ef4) for spearheading this
approach).
