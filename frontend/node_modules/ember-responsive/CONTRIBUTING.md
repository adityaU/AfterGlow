# Questions

This is the issue tracker for Ember Responsive but it's perfectly fine to ask
questions here. Just open up and ticket and inquire within!

# Issues

Think you've found a bug or have a new feature to suggest? Let us know!

## Reporting a Bug

1. Update to the most recent master release, if possible. Verify the bug exists
   on master.

2. Provide with a bug report that shows the problem.

3. If possible, submit a Pull Request with a failing test. Better yet, take
   a stab at fixing the bug yourself if you can!

The more information you provide, the easier it is for us to validate that
there is a bug and the faster we'll be able to take action.

# Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests

3. Add tests for your change. We use both intregration and unit tests, depending
   on what you're writing you may have to write both style of tests.

4. Make the test pass.

5. Commit your changes. If your pull request fixes an issue specify it in the
   commit message.
   Here's an example: `git commit -m "Close #19 - Fix media listener for mobile"`
