# plotly_bower

Simply include plotly.js as a bower dependency by running:

`bower install plotly --save`

The bower package contains the **not** minified version v1.18.1.

This is not a mistake but a way to fix a grunt uglify bug, which does sometimes not work with pre-minified files. 
See [this] (https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/issues/233) for more information.
